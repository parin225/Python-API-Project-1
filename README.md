* The temperature of cities located North of the equator experience lower temperatures compared to cities located South of the equator. In addition, the futher away North the city is from the equator, the lower the temperature is.
 
* Based on this information, there appears to be no correlation with the city's cloudiness factor and its' latitude. There also appears to be no correlation with the wind speed a city experiences and the latitude of the city. 

* There appears to be no correlation with a city's humidity and its' latitude. However, most cities appear to experience 50% or more humidity.
